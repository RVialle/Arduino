# Pulse-Duplicator
Pulse Duplicator Project

The general objective of this research was defined as the development of a cardiac phantom that is capable of reproducing the systole 
and diastole movements of the left ventricle of the human heart, using segmentation techniques based on tomographic images, structured
through the manufacturing process additive and controlled by means of a microcontroller.
